Problem:  Sort an array of 0’s 1’s 2’s without using extra space or sorting algo (Sort_Colors)

Approach:
1. Have 3 variables to hold index of 0, 1 and 2 as zero -> 0, one -> 1, second -> 2
2. If current element is 0 then we have to make room for it so, in order to do it we need to move 2's, 1's. For 1 and 2 as well same logic is to be implemented to have space for 1 and 2 as well.
